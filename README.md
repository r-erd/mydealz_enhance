    - grayscale mode
    - hide images
    - hide categories banner

## Usage

This is fairly easy.
- Step 1: Download the most recent version from the releases section.
- Step 2: follow [this guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) on how to install an unpacked extension in Google Chrome. Or [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/extension-sideloading) on how to install an unpacked extension in Microsoft Edge.

Some day I might also publish it on the Google Chrome Extension Store.

## Development

I never did anything related to chrome extensions before and I heavily relied on ChatGPT when I put this together - so its probably far from perfect. If you spot any issues or have suggestions for improvements feel free to open an issue (or a pull request).
